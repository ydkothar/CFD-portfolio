# Oil-Water_Emulsions_with_Soluble_Surfactants

## Objective
The goal of this project was to develop a diffuse interface model for a system of immiscible liquids (oil and water) and soluble surfactants. The objective was to accurately predict the reduction in surface tension caused by surfactants, a key factor in enhancing oil recovery (EOR) processes.

## Approach
- **CFD Code Development**: FORTRAN
- **Model**: Phase field model (i.e., Diffuse interface model)
- **Numerical Methods**: Lattice Boltzmann Method and Finite Difference Method
- **Post-processing**: Python, MATLAB, ParaView 

## Results
- **Adsorption Dynamics of Surfactans on the interface of oil-water drop**:



Here, $\phi$.
